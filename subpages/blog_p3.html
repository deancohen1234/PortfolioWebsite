  	<p>Greetings! For this week I worked on refining the checkpoint system, the wind gusting, and the UI. I created a life/energy bar that depletes when the player uses a gust. I made the gust system work a little more consistently, though it is still a bit touch and go. And I created a little particle system for the checkpoints, to show when the player activates them. With these things done I may do some play testing with friends to see what can be improved upon and changed! This coming week I will be doing a Game Jam over the weekend so I may not get as much done as I would like, but overall I am planning on adding a wind effect on the player when they use a gust, as well as add some camera shake for extra effect. I also will try and work on a little bit more art with some props and background objects as well. That is all for this week, and thank you very much for reading. It means a lot! Have a lovely week!</p>

      <h5>New Mechanics and Lighting, <span class="w3-opacity">July 15, 2019</span></h5>
    </div>	  
  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Hello! So this week I worked on what I really enjoy doing which is mechanics. I created a rough base for the wind gust mechanic of movement as well as I made a basic framework for a checkpoint system. This all has to do with the game design decisions I got help with last week. Overall I'm pretty excited to see how everything is turning out so far. I also started playing around with lighting and particle systems. Nothing to crazy or concrete I just wanted to experiment with 2D lighting as I have never worked with it before. So for next week I'm hoping to get the gust mechanic more defined with a power bar that decreases the more you use it. I also want to get the checkpoint system working more to my liking, with some effects and lighting. That's all I have for this week, I hope you enjoyed and have a great day!</p>

  	<p>Greetings! So because of the 4th of July and helping some friends move I haven't been able to get as much done as I want. However this week I met with a great game designer friend of mine who really helped me get a much more clear idea of what the game should be. So I now have plans set to make some pretty big changes to the game's structure. First I am going to make the air mobility of the player a little bit less, just to simulate a leaf more. And from this I plan on adding wind mechanic that uses a sort of life force, to blow the character around. It's going to be an interesting challenge and should hopefully make the game stand out as far as movement is concerned. For the next week I'm hoping to at least begin working on some the brainstormed ideas, hopefully getting the gust working in a very basic sense. Thank you all and I will try and have more done by next week!</p>

    </div>	  
  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Hello! So for this week I focused a fair amount on getting a little bit more of the visuals in place. Unfortunetly I am not the best at that currently. I added the basics of a walk cycle for the character and drafted out some concept art for the tree. As for the mechanics a spent a lot of time making a better camera controller. It now works much more smoothly and will auto pan when the player goes out of a specified frame. As for next week I want to add a backgroudn with some parallax as well as add some lighting to the scene. On top of that I want to play around more with the level design and try and make the next sequence of platforming challenges. Thank you very much fo reading and I will see you next week!</p>

      <h5>New System and Block-Out, <span class="w3-opacity">June 24, 2019</span></h5>
    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Welcome back! I hope days have been joyful at times! As for progress I have started blocking out the beginning layout of the game. This involves having the player start at the bottom of the tree and learn the mechanics of jumping and climbing to reach the top. I also added an entirely new system of bezier curve based water veins the player can ride. These are based off xylem tubes inside trees.  They are made entirely from code and are very fun to play with. Upon thinking about what I planned for last week I realized that the tortilla roll just wasn't going to work the way I wanted, so I pivotted to the xylem riding. I also am still working on my 2D asset creation course and will hopefully have another asset to put into the game. Thanks for reading and see you next week!</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>As of now the player is able to move around, jump, double jump, wall slide, and wall jump. These are the core of how the game will be played and as of now feel pretty good.  They will most likely need some reworking but as of right now they feel solid. Currently I have been using tutorials online to help in the creation of the assets. Including a Udemy course on 2D asset creation which is where the awesome platforms come in. First 2D asset wooooo! Next week I plan to have another asset in the game, but mainly I want to make my secondary mechanic of having the player be able to transform and roll in a little tortilla. Wish me luck!</p>
