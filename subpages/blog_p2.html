  	<p>Hello! So this week I worked on a couple different things. As the title explains, I worked on what happens when the player dies. I made a simple particle system that plays and set it up so if I add some extra animation to the player I can add that in without too much hastle. I also began adding a couple more frames to the run animation for the character, and I am planning on reworking their run so it looks less jank. For this next week I am hoping to actually do a bit of code refactoring for the scripts I've wrote so far, as well as try and do more art and animation. The art is definitely my weak suit so I am hoping to improve it and keep motivation as the weeks continue. Anyways that's all for this week. Thanks and have great day!</p>

  	<p>Salutations! So last week was a bit of hectic week for me. With 3 interviews and a lot of personal work to do I didn't focus as much as I could have on the game. But alas I got a small amount of work done! I began animating the new character for the game. The character's legs are a bit lanky and long, but overall it's not terrible. I plan on adding more frame to smooth out the motion as well as a little cloak of leaves for some style. For this week I also am planning on putting this character in the game and maybe also making a simple death animation and sequence. Overall though that is about it. Thank you for reading and I will see you all next week!</p>

  	<p>Hello! I hope you're doing well! So for this week I did a combination of a couple of different things. I finally got a book on animation and made my first walk cycle and I'm pretty happy with it. It acted as a kind of simple test run for my character's walk. And speaking/writing of the character I decided that I  wanted a redesign for him/her. So I started working on a redesign for the character that may be a little simpler. Already I'm liking how it looks so much more than the way it is now! So for next week I want to get a better concept art piece drawn up for the character and experiment more with the level design. At this stage of development I have never really gotten to so this will be exciting to see and experience for everyone. Thank you so much and I will see you all next week.</p>

  	<p>Salutations! So this week I worked on blocking out and testing how the movement system feels in an environment. Overall I think with some tweaking there is some real potential! I'm first testing it in a more closed environment with a tighter camera but I may this week try and make a level that's a little more opena and non-linear. I also added my first bit of new animation in a while. I'm using new software to make it and spent a fair amount of time coming up with a workflow but I think I have a solid system now. For this week I recently got a book on animation so my goal is to make a decent walking animation for the character. That's it for this week , thank you and have a great day!</p>

  	<p>Hello! Soooo this week I did a separate game jam which took up the majority of my time unfortunately. I did make an awesome game which is in my portfolio page, but I didn't get to work on this game too much. So I aplogize for that. But this week I plan to keep at the work I wa going to do last week.  I did make the wind gusting more consistent which is great! For this week I am going to block out some level design and play through them just to see how it all feels. I mayh also work a bit more on concept art as well. Thank you all very much and sorry for the short update! </p>

  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Hello! This week I pretty much did all my work in one very productive night which worked out well! I added a camera shake system and began testing my main mechanic of wind gusting. To the wind gust I added a time slow effect which works to give the player more time to plan out their movement. I also created a basic background and some simple particle effects for the game. On top of that I met with my game design friend Aaron who looked at the game and gave some great advice on how to take it further. So for the coming week I am going to try and refine the gust system so it works consistently, and once that is good I will try and begin blocking out levels to see what is fun. This weekend I am planning on doing a game jam so I may not have as much done as I would like but I will see what I can do. Thank you all very much and have a great week!</p>
