    <p>Hello! So I first want to apologize for not writing a blog last week. The reasoning for that was Halloween and a separate game demo I did at a local bar. And because of that I also wanted to break the news that development for Rejuvenate is going to be slowed way down for a while. The game I demoed at our local bar was a real hit and I want to be focusing my efforts on bringing that game to completion as quick as possible. This doesn't mean Rejuvenate is over, rather I am just going to be taking a break for development for a little bit while our other game is being worked on. I plan to resume development on Rejuvenate around March or April 2020. I want to really thank everyone who has read along with me on this journey and I will keep you all posted on how our other game is going. Thank you all so much!</p>

  	<p>Hello! So this week I finished up the first level's blockout. I also was lucky enough to get a friend to test the level and give some feedback. Overall he was able to finish it and also defintiely found some cheeky ways around the level that I did not intend for. It was great! He also mentioned that I should change how the character activates their wind gusts. Currently it requires two buttons, but he recommended that I condense it down to just using the right stick. I definitely agree with him and I hope this week I can work to implement that. I have also been working a secondary project with him that you can view on my main portfolio site if you are interested. Other than polishing and reworking the movement that is all I have for this week. I wish you all the best and I will see you next week!</p>
