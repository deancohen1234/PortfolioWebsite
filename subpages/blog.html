      <p>As of now the player is able to move around, jump, double jump, wall slide, and wall jump. These are the core of how the game will be played and as of now feel pretty good.  They will most likely need some reworking but as of right now they feel solid. Currently I have been using tutorials online to help in the creation of the assets. Including a Udemy course on 2D asset creation which is where the awesome platforms come in. First 2D asset wooooo! Next week I plan to have another asset in the game, but mainly I want to make my secondary mechanic of having the player be able to transform and roll in a little tortilla. Wish me luck!</p>

    </div>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Welcome back! I hope days have been joyful at times! As for progress I have started blocking out the beginning layout of the game. This involves having the player start at the bottom of the tree and learn the mechanics of jumping and climbing to reach the top. I also added an entirely new system of bezier curve based water veins the player can ride. These are based off xylem tubes inside trees.  They are made entirely from code and are very fun to play with. Upon thinking about what I planned for last week I realized that the tortilla roll just wasn't going to work the way I wanted, so I pivotted to the xylem riding. I also am still working on my 2D asset creation course and will hopefully have another asset to put into the game. Thanks for reading and see you next week!</p>

  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Hello! So for this week I focused a fair amount on getting a little bit more of the visuals in place. Unfortunetly I am not the best at that currently. I added the basics of a walk cycle for the character and drafted out some concept art for the tree. As for the mechanics a spent a lot of time making a better camera controller. It now works much more smoothly and will auto pan when the player goes out of a specified frame. As for next week I want to add a backgroudn with some parallax as well as add some lighting to the scene. On top of that I want to play around more with the level design and try and make the next sequence of platforming challenges. Thank you very much fo reading and I will see you next week!</p>

    </div>	  
  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Greetings! So because of the 4th of July and helping some friends move I haven't been able to get as much done as I want. However this week I met with a great game designer friend of mine who really helped me get a much more clear idea of what the game should be. So I now have plans set to make some pretty big changes to the game's structure. First I am going to make the air mobility of the player a little bit less, just to simulate a leaf more. And from this I plan on adding wind mechanic that uses a sort of life force, to blow the character around. It's going to be an interesting challenge and should hopefully make the game stand out as far as movement is concerned. For the next week I'm hoping to at least begin working on some the brainstormed ideas, hopefully getting the gust working in a very basic sense. Thank you all and I will try and have more done by next week!</p>

    </div>	  
  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Hello! So this week I worked on what I really enjoy doing which is mechanics. I created a rough base for the wind gust mechanic of movement as well as I made a basic framework for a checkpoint system. This all has to do with the game design decisions I got help with last week. Overall I'm pretty excited to see how everything is turning out so far. I also started playing around with lighting and particle systems. Nothing to crazy or concrete I just wanted to experiment with 2D lighting as I have never worked with it before. So for next week I'm hoping to get the gust mechanic more defined with a power bar that decreases the more you use it. I also want to get the checkpoint system working more to my liking, with some effects and lighting. That's all I have for this week, I hope you enjoyed and have a great day!</p>

  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Greetings! For this week I worked on refining the checkpoint system, the wind gusting, and the UI. I created a life/energy bar that depletes when the player uses a gust. I made the gust system work a little more consistently, though it is still a bit touch and go. And I created a little particle system for the checkpoints, to show when the player activates them. With these things done I may do some play testing with friends to see what can be improved upon and changed! This coming week I will be doing a Game Jam over the weekend so I may not get as much done as I would like, but overall I am planning on adding a wind effect on the player when they use a gust, as well as add some camera shake for extra effect. I also will try and work on a little bit more art with some props and background objects as well. That is all for this week, and thank you very much for reading. It means a lot! Have a lovely week!</p>

  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Hello! This week I pretty much did all my work in one very productive night which worked out well! I added a camera shake system and began testing my main mechanic of wind gusting. To the wind gust I added a time slow effect which works to give the player more time to plan out their movement. I also created a basic background and some simple particle effects for the game. On top of that I met with my game design friend Aaron who looked at the game and gave some great advice on how to take it further. So for the coming week I am going to try and refine the gust system so it works consistently, and once that is good I will try and begin blocking out levels to see what is fun. This weekend I am planning on doing a game jam so I may not have as much done as I would like but I will see what I can do. Thank you all very much and have a great week!</p>

  	<p>Hello! Soooo this week I did a separate game jam which took up the majority of my time unfortunately. I did make an awesome game which is in my portfolio page, but I didn't get to work on this game too much. So I aplogize for that. But this week I plan to keep at the work I wa going to do last week.  I did make the wind gusting more consistent which is great! For this week I am going to block out some level design and play through them just to see how it all feels. I mayh also work a bit more on concept art as well. Thank you all very much and sorry for the short update! </p>

    </div>	  
  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Salutations! So this week I worked on blocking out and testing how the movement system feels in an environment. Overall I think with some tweaking there is some real potential! I'm first testing it in a more closed environment with a tighter camera but I may this week try and make a level that's a little more opena and non-linear. I also added my first bit of new animation in a while. I'm using new software to make it and spent a fair amount of time coming up with a workflow but I think I have a solid system now. For this week I recently got a book on animation so my goal is to make a decent walking animation for the character. That's it for this week , thank you and have a great day!</p>

  	<p>Hello! I hope you're doing well! So for this week I did a combination of a couple of different things. I finally got a book on animation and made my first walk cycle and I'm pretty happy with it. It acted as a kind of simple test run for my character's walk. And speaking/writing of the character I decided that I  wanted a redesign for him/her. So I started working on a redesign for the character that may be a little simpler. Already I'm liking how it looks so much more than the way it is now! So for next week I want to get a better concept art piece drawn up for the character and experiment more with the level design. At this stage of development I have never really gotten to so this will be exciting to see and experience for everyone. Thank you so much and I will see you all next week.</p>

  	<p>Salutations! So last week was a bit of hectic week for me. With 3 interviews and a lot of personal work to do I didn't focus as much as I could have on the game. But alas I got a small amount of work done! I began animating the new character for the game. The character's legs are a bit lanky and long, but overall it's not terrible. I plan on adding more frame to smooth out the motion as well as a little cloak of leaves for some style. For this week I also am planning on putting this character in the game and maybe also making a simple death animation and sequence. Overall though that is about it.

  	<p>Hello! So this week I worked on a couple different things. As the title explains, I worked on what happens when the player dies. I made a simple particle system that plays and set it up so if I add some extra animation to the player I can add that in without too much hastle. I also began adding a couple more frames to the run animation for the character, and I am planning on reworking their run so it looks less jank. For this next week I am hoping to actually do a bit of code refactoring for the scripts I've wrote so far, as well as try and do more art and animation. The art is definitely my weak suit so I am hoping to improve it and keep motivation as the weeks continue. Anyways that's all for this week. Thanks and have great day!</p>

  	<p>Salutations! So this week I focused my time on drawing and animating. And for the first time I had a moment where I was enjoying doing it! So I tried making some extra effects like lights and backgrounds! They are definitely rough but I learned how to use custom brushes, and that is something! I also reworked the character running animation, and it looks a lot better now. I all mostly came down to the legs. So for next week I hope to get those animations in the game and maybe play around with the character movement some more. It feels a little stiff currently and the camera controls are a bit odd, especially when flying through the air. I also will try and just draw and sketch more to hopefully enjoy it more and practice! Well that's it for this week, thanks for reading and I apologize for the slow progress. Life is an odd beast. But progress is progress none of the less!</p>

  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Hello! So this week I focused on fixing the camera code. Previously I thought the way to work my camera was only move it vertically when the player reached certain bound in the viewing space. However that made actual vertical movement very odd and difficult. So busted out some games with similar camera movement and analyzed them. What I found is that the camera is always following the player, both vertically and horizontally, just at different speeds. I implemented that system into my game along with some extra falling code and that helped a bunch! I also discovered in Unity you can color your Debug.Log functions, which was wonderful! For this week I'm planning on adding a couple more background objects into the scene. And maybe planning out the first sequence of platforming jumps. Thanks for reading and I will see you next week! </p>

I did do a litte sktechting of objects I want to put into the game, but I didn't end up actually drawing them digitally quite yet. I also started getting a little bit back into C++ coding as well which ate up some of my time. And I pet-sitted for a friend. But excuses aside now that I am a little more settled I am hoping to draw in those sketches for next week. I am just gonna try and focus on that and maybe do some extra animation too.

  	<p>Hello friends! So for the past week I focused on FINALLY getting my drawings done digitally. And I finally gritted through and did some of them. I also started working on a little bit on animation as well! I worked a fair amount just some background props and effects like a lamp, butterfly, and a sort of pulsing circle effect. This week my new job is doing a massive Hackathon so I don't think I will be able to get too much done but I will try and put together some of the effects and assets I made this week into Unity for display. Also my family gave me a perfect acorn to use a reference for the character design. So I will try and work to draw up some cute animations for the little spirit guy. Anyways that's all I have for this week, but thank you for reading and I will see you next week!</p>
