  	<p>Hello! So I made some pretty solid progress despite some minor inconveniences this week like getting a little sick. The first half or so of the first level has been blocked out and it plays pretty solid. There are definitely some adjustments to be made with the gliding and jumping but overall it's a great start. I also began work on making a state machine for the AI enemies that will show up in later levels. There really isn't too much to show for that other than some debug logs. So as for next week I am hoping to keep on the pace of work I have going and finish the blocking of the first level. Even if it is a bit rough and feel awkward to play I want to get that squared away. I also may work on a jump animation for the character. It just feels so sad to jump right now with the character having no other animation. I think that is all for this week. I hope we all have an above average week and see you on the 21st!</p>

    </div>	  
  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Greetings! So as you may have noticed I redesigned the website to help the long loading times. I completely did not think about that when originally creating this. Anyways that took up a fair amount of my time this week, along with some other personal projects I had to do 12 hours days at work, so needless to say I didn't get much done. But that segways nicely into my plans for this week! I am going to test out hard scheduling myself to do 10 hours a week of work for Rejuvenate. I want to get a gauge to see if I can make that happen and see how dead or alive I am by next Monday. This way I can also hold myself a little more accountable for how much work I am putting in each week. Regardless for this week I did make simple sketch of the whole layout for the first level. It's rough, but by next week I want to put it in the game. It is definitely in the realm of 10 hours of work. Anyways that is all for this week. Thank you for tuning in and I will see you next week!</p>

  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Hello friends! So for the past week I focused on FINALLY getting my drawings done digitally. And I finally gritted through and did some of them. I also started working on a little bit on animation as well! I worked a fair amount just some background props and effects like a lamp, butterfly, and a sort of pulsing circle effect. This week my new job is doing a massive Hackathon so I don't think I will be able to get too much done but I will try and put together some of the effects and assets I made this week into Unity for display. Also my family gave me a perfect acorn to use a reference for the character design. So I will try and work to draw up some cute animations for the little spirit guy. Anyways that's all I have for this week, but thank you for reading and I will see you next week!</p>

  	<p>Hello friends! Soooo this week I started my new job, which meant I was kinda dealing with a lot and wasn't able to work as much as I wanted to. I did do a litte sktechting of objects I want to put into the game, but I didn't end up actually drawing them digitally quite yet. I also started getting a little bit back into C++ coding as well which ate up some of my time. And I pet-sitted for a friend. But excuses aside now that I am a little more settled I am hoping to draw in those sketches for next week. I am just gonna try and focus on that and maybe do some extra animation too. That's all I have for this week. Thanks!</p>

      <h5>Cameras and Logging, <span class="w3-opacity">September 16, 2019</span></h5>
    </div>	  
  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Hello! So this week I focused on fixing the camera code. Previously I thought the way to work my camera was only move it vertically when the player reached certain bound in the viewing space. However that made actual vertical movement very odd and difficult. So busted out some games with similar camera movement and analyzed them. What I found is that the camera is always following the player, both vertically and horizontally, just at different speeds. I implemented that system into my game along with some extra falling code and that helped a bunch! I also discovered in Unity you can color your Debug.Log functions, which was wonderful! For this week I'm planning on adding a couple more background objects into the scene. And maybe planning out the first sequence of platforming jumps. Thanks for reading and I will see you next week! </p>

      <h5>Drawing and New Brushes, <span class="w3-opacity">September 9, 2019</span></h5>
    </div>	  
  	<div class="w3-container">
  	<p>Salutations! So this week I focused my time on drawing and animating. And for the first time I had a moment where I was enjoying doing it! So I tried making some extra effects like lights and backgrounds! They are definitely rough but I learned how to use custom brushes, and that is something! I also reworked the character running animation, and it looks a lot better now. I all mostly came down to the legs. So for next week I hope to get those animations in the game and maybe play around with the character movement some more. It feels a little stiff currently and the camera controls are a bit odd, especially when flying through the air. I also will try and just draw and sketch more to hopefully enjoy it more and practice! Well that's it for this week, thanks for reading and I apologize for the slow progress. Life is an odd beast. But progress is progress none of the less!</p>
